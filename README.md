# Homework Assignment 9: Greedy Algorithms
Note: This homework assignment should be submitted individually or as a pair. If working with a partner, both partners must submit identical files.

Start all assignments in this class at least four days before the deadline. This will enable you to get help when needed and ensure your success in this course.

Please read the entire assignment description prior to starting any part.

Goal
The goal of this assignment is for you to think through multiple greedy strategies for the same problem.

Instructions
See individual parts.

## Part #1: Programming
**Choose one of the following problems** from the lecture notes: **"Map Coloring" or "Traveling Salesperson".**

From your chosen problem, **choose a dataset of at least 50 elements with appropriate information.** We strongly suggest you store this information as a .csv file. We provide example .csv files (see attached) that you are free to use, though **you may create/find your own dataset.**

Read the data from step 2 into a Python program for analysis.

**Create functions for _two_ different greedy strategies**. For example, one strategy for the set-covering problem discussed in class was to "pick the station that covers the most states", but alternatively you could have "pick the state that is covered by the least stations".

**Create a main for the user to choose which strategy to run and communicate the output in a readable way** (either through another .csv file or on the console output).

## Part #2: Analysis
In a separate document, w**rite 1-2 sentences introducing which problem you chose**. Followed by a **short paragraph explaining your two strategies and which one you think is better**. **Include the time complexity** in your discussion. **Explain your choice of representation for the data used in the problem**. For the **set-covering problem discussed in class, you would explain why the problem is stored as a dictionary of sets**.

Give an **explanation of your most optimal solution and show your results visually**. You **may use Map Chart or other resources (including RStudio) to create your visualizations**.

## Submissions
For **Part 1**, your submission **must be named hwk9.py and must conform to the Rules for Programming Assignments.** Your submission **should also include any additional .csv files required to run your code**.

For **Part 2**, your submission must either use the Overleaf template or be typed using a simple font (e.g., Arial) with a complete course header at the top of the file. All pseudocode must be written using our Pseudocode Conventions. Your file should then be converted to .pdf and called **hwk9-analysis.pdf.**

Reminder that your header should include the following:

Name:       - your name
Peers:      - names of CSC252 students who you consulted or "N/A"
References: - URL of resources used or "N/A"
For hwk9.py, ensure that you:

Cite your sources
Include a dataset of at least 50 elements with appropriate information
Read the dataset into a Python program
Have Strategy 1 and its function and the strategy is greedy and reasonable
Have Strategy 2 and its function and the strategy is greedy and reasonable
Have a main function with user input to run a strategy
Program output is reasonably readable or appropriately stored
For hwk9-analysis.pdf, ensure that you:

Cite your sources
Introduce the problem
Write a short paragraph explaining your two strategies
Argue for which strategy is better
Discuss the time complexity of each strategy
Discuss your choice of data representation
Give an explanation of your most optimal solution
Add visuals to show the results of your strategies
